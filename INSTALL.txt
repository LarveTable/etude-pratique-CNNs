To install and run this project :

    - Download COCO annotations at 'http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip'

    - Unzip the file (if it hasn't done it itself)

    - Place the resulted "annotations" file in 'main/explanai/cocoapi'

    - Open a terminal and run "make" under 'main/explanai/cocoapi/PythonAPI' (you will need "gcc" or any c compiler, and "make" commands
    installed)

    - Install poetry (it can be found at : "https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer")

    - Open a terminal in '../main' (you should be in the folder "etude-pratique-CNNs").

    - Run 'poetry install --no-root'

    - Now that all the dependancies are installed, you can check if everything works by running 
    'poetry run python main/explanai/manage.py', you should get a list of available commands.

    - To start the application, just run 'poetry run python main/explanai/manage.py runserver'. The first 
    start may take some time to initialize some packages dependancies.

    - When the server has started, you'll see "Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/",
    just open this localhost adress with your web browser and you're done !

Known bugs : 
    - On Linux mainly, when running "make" under 'main/explanai/cocoapi/PythonAPI', it can 
    fail because it tries compiling with the command "python", but depending on your Python install,
    your only available command could be "python3". I did not found a fix yet, but you could try to
    install an older version of Python (which had "python" as alias), and use it to run "make".
